# DevMind 

DevMind is my personal programming practice space - a place where I sharpen my problem-solving skills, experiment with new conectps, and build the mindset of a developer.

This repository will contain coding exercise, small projects, logic challenges, and anything else that helps me grow as a programmer.

# The goal : improve daily, think better, code smarter
